v0.7.6
  - Upgrade button in list view: The upgrade button now appears on every upgradable node in list view.
  - Native-mode restart preserves running nodes: When Formicaio runs in native mode and the process is terminated with a kill signal (e.g. using kill -9 <PID> or tools like btop), you can restart Formicaio without stopping nodes that were already active. On startup, Formicaio will detect and continue tracking those running nodes. If Formicaio was otherwise stopped with Ctrl+C, nodes will be shut down as in previous versions.
v0.7.5
  - Allow to sort nodes by their binary version.
  - Detect and track native node processes that restarted themselves with a new PID due to natively upgrading.
  - Detect and allow dockerised nodes to restart when natively upgrading themselves.
  - When nodes are discovered with new PIDs and version, update local DB cache.
  - Minor improvements to node card placeholder when creating nodes or scheduling batches.
  - Icon and style tweaks, removing redundant color classes, and minor refactoring in rendering node info.
v0.7.4
  - Fix a minor issue in dashboard balance addresses which had a redundant '0x' prefix.
v0.7.3
  - Dashboard enhancement where hovering the mouse over the balance card reveals a list of reward addresses assigned to all nodes and their respective balances, allowing users to click on each address to view detailed information on Arbiscan (https://arbiscan.io) explorer.
v0.7.2
  - New section in settings for users to define the frequency for checking the disk usage of nodes (default 60 secs).
  - The dashboard now shows the total amount of bytes used by all nodes, along with the overall disk usage status.
  - Individual node disk usage is now tracked and reported.
  - Fixed an issue where redundant disks were included when checking disk usage, leading to more accurate reporting in those scenarios.
  - Users can now sort nodes based on disk usage.
v0.7.1
  - Node actions are applied without creating a batch when only a single node was selected.
  - The dashboard now includes a disk usage report card. Note that this report currently does not distinguish between the usage attributed to the running nodes and other applications using the drive/s.
  - Support for alternating between tile and list layouts in the nodes page.
  - New sections in settings so users can set their default nodes page layout (tile/list) and page size.

v0.7.0
  - Revamped design and enhanced user experience for the GUI.

v0.6.0
  - Removed home-network/relayed mode for nodes.
  - Node auto-upgrades are now executed as a batch of node actions, giving users clear visibility into when auto-upgrade is in progress and the option to cancel it if desired.
  - Internal codebase refactoring to improve organization and reduce technical debt.
  - Enhanced documentation for public data types and updated parts of the README instructions.

v0.5.6
  - GUI enhancements: Separated basic and advanced options for adding nodes
  - Minor GUI fix: Resolved an issue where adding new node(s) would fail, it now removes the placeholder node and displays an popup alert message
  - Custom Data Directory: Users can now (optionally) specify a custom data directory path for each new node or batch of new nodes
  - Error Response Improvement: Enhanced the GUI error response for 404 page
  - Codebase Refactor: Conducted a refactor of the codebase and added unit tests for a few data types and private APIs

v0.5.5
  - Allow the user to specify the IP the node/s should listen on. The IP can be either set from the GUI or using a new `--ip-addr` argument now supported by the CLI `nodes create` command.

v0.5.4
  ## Node management made easy

  With Formicaio, you can easily run and manage nodes using either a graphical
  user interface (GUI) or a terminal. This flexibility allows you to perform
  various actions on individual nodes or groups of selected nodes, including:
  - Creating new nodes
  - Starting or stopping nodes
  - Recycling nodes to generate a new peer ID
  - Removing nodes
  - Upgrading nodes when a new binary version is available
  - Viewing individual node logs in real time
  - Monitoring memory and CPU usage with detailed charts
  - Sorting nodes by different criteria, such as creation date, status, or number of connected peers

  The Formicaio backend actively monitors your nodes, providing real-time
  status updates and statistics, including:
  - Rewards balance for each node
  - Memory and CPU usage
  - Number of records stored locally
  - Current peer connections
  - Peers in the routing table
  - Peers that have shunned the node(s)
  - Estimated total nodes in the network

  ## Customizable monitoring and management

  A settings panel allows you to customize monitoring tasks and node management, including:
  - Auto-upgrading nodes when a new binary version is available
  - Delay settings for node upgrades
  - Frequency of version checks for the node binary
  - Frequency of token balance queries
  - Frequency of metrics and node information retrieval
  - Configuration of the ERC20 token contract address and RPC URL for reward balance queries
  - Displaying node statistics on an external LCD device (via I2C interface)

  ## Connection types for nodes

  When setting up nodes, you can define their connection type:
  - Home-Network mode: Ideal for nodes behind a NAT without port forwarding. This mode activates hole-punching to facilitate direct connections from other nodes. If this not enabled and you're behind a NAT, nodes will struggle to connect to other peers.
  - UPnP support: Attempt to use UPnP to open a port on your home router for incoming connections. If your router does not support or is not configured for UPnP, create new nodes with UPnP disabled to ensure connectivity.
